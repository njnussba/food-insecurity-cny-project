<p class="paragraph">Food insecurity, when a household doesn’t have consistent access to food, has been a major issue in the United States, specifically central New York, for the past decade. In a survey conducted in 2023, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/#map">the U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> reported levels reached 14.9% in 2011, the highest of the 21st century.</p>

<p class="paragraph">By 2020, the percentage had dipped to 10.5%, mostly due to the work of national and local organizations. But then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Many people lost their jobs and were immediately thrust into food insecurity. Because there were more people in need, pantries like the Food Bank of Central New York were forced to acquire more space and staff to operate.</p>

<p class="paragraph">These pantries were overwhelmed, and numbers skyrocketed as a result. From March 2020 to January 2023, the duration of the pandemic in America, food insecurity levels increased to 13.5%. Organizations were forced to work overtime to come up with solutions before it was too late.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In central New York, groups such as the Syracuse-Onondaga Food Systems Alliance (SOFSA) and Food Bank of CNY have been working nonstop since the start of the pandemic. SOFSA has organized meetings to discuss potential solutions, mainly advocating for food stamp increases. Additionally, the Food Bank of CNY has tried new projects to mitigate the effects of unreliable transportation in parts of the region.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“What we’re doing is convening different people that either have experience of the problem, have power to address the problem, have innovative solutions that they're proposing, convening them and trying to align like resources and folks in a room to get projects done,” SOFSA Food Systems Organizer Micah Orieta said.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Across America, food insecurity has been the most prevalent in the South. Arkansas (18.9%), Texas (16.9%) and Louisiana (16.2%) had the highest levels in 2023, per <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/#trends">the U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. Though the figure is lower in New York, only hitting <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/#map">12.3%</a>, that’s still significantly higher than it needs to be, according to Orieta.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The biggest reasons for these numbers are the lack of accessible grocery stores and transportation. There are numerous areas in Syracuse, for example, that are miles away from the closest grocery store. In addition, people that live there don’t have their own cars or even a close bus stop, forcing them to find different ways to get food.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“When you're using public transportation, it's very difficult to transport groceries. And you may have to walk several blocks to get to a food pantry from where the bus would leave you off,” Lynn Hy, Food Bank of CNY’s Chief Development Officer, said.</p>

<p class="paragraph">To fix this, the Food Bank of CNY launched <a href="https://www.wrvo.org/2024-11-19/food-bank-of-cny-unveils-new-locker-program-in-oswego-cortland-counties">"food lockers"</a> in Hastings and Truxton, New York, in September. These lockers were designed so people in rural communities could more easily access food.</p>

<p class="paragraph">According to Hy, the lockers operate as a “drive through” food pantry. People in need can punch in a code, and a locker will open with the food they ask for. The cells are also temperature controlled, so they can hold both perishable and nonperishable items.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“There's not a ton of food banks that have done this already,” Hy said. “We got a grant to test it out, to try and increase that access for people that do have limitations in those communities, because there isn't a food pantry serving that community directly.”</p>

<p class="paragraph">Though this project is only a few months old, Hy said it's been largely successful. She feels that it can help fix transportation and store access issues across Syracuse.</p>

<p class="paragraph">SOFSA has been putting in effort to combat food insecurity as well. Per Orieta, the most effective way so far has been food stamp increases. SOFSA’s asked local government officials to raise them to 100 per month. Still, he thinks the government hasn’t been doing its part, relying on organizations and food banks to do its job.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“What a lot of governments do in the US at different scales is they say, ‘There's organizations that are set up to meet that need, right? We have food pantries and we have food banks, so we don't need to expend as much effort in doing that. We can give them money and they'll feed people,’” Orieta said.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In response, SOFSA has acted as an intermediary, bringing people with different expertises together to come up with solutions. It also began holding community listening sessions in 2023, so that citizens could express their challenges and where they want to see change.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Hy believes that partnering with more groups like SOFSA in the future can help further mitigate food insecurity. She also thinks collaborating with healthcare and wellness organizations will play a factor as well.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“Food is just one component of what's going on in somebody's life,” Hy said. “What are the other organizations (that) can help a person access all of the benefits they need, so hopefully they can pull themselves up out of the situation that they're in?”</p>

<p class="paragraph">However, Orieta still thinks the future is bleak. Since housing costs and rent are increasing, it’s becoming even harder for people to set aside enough money for food.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In addition, many groups rely on federal funding, which has never been consistently allocated to them. Overall, Orieta believes food insecurity will more than likely continue to get worse, a bad sign for the future of the country.</p>

<p class="paragraph">“The landscape is pretty blurry,” Orieta said. “Unfortunately, I think everybody's flying by the seat of their pants.”</p>
